This workshop aims to bring together both theoreticians and experimentalists who work on understanding metal-oxide/water interactions in electrochemistry. It will serve as the venue to join the efforts of experts in electro/geochemistry, surface science, catalysis, energy storage, and materials modeling/theoretical chemistry. The workshop will consist of invited presentations and provide ample time for discussions. 

The organizers,


Veronica Augustyn  (North Carolina State University, USA)
Jan Balajka (Vienna University of Technology, Austria)
Evert Jan Meijer (University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands)
Chao Zhang (Uppsala University, Sweden)
